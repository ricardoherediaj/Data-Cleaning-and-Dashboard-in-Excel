# Data-Cleaning-and-Dashboard-in-Excel

In this project we downloaded a Bike Sales dataset from from this GitHub profile https://github.com/AlexTheAnalyst/Excel-Tutorial/blob/main/Excel%20Project%20Dataset.xls and used it to clean, explore and visualize the data through a final dashboard. Below I've made a step by step description of my process and how I tackled it: 

1. Dowload the dataset as a .xls file. 

2. Open it in Excel and created 3 new sheets in order to have a work organization: Worksheet, Pivot Table, Dashboard. 

3. Copy the whole table from the bike_buyers sheet and Paste it on the Worksheet sheet in order to keep the raw data as it is to avoid issues and mess it up.

4. Apply a filter to every column first, to know the data we’re working with.

5. Check for Duplicates before doing anything → 26 duplicates were removed out of 1000
